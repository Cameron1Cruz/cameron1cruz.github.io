# About

I am a cybersecurity professional, and have a passion for all things tech.
In my spare time I run this blog named CruzOnCyber. I talk about various topics
ranging from fundamental information security to fun projects I am working on. I
want to focus on security engineering and expand my skills into embedded systems.
I hope this blog serves as a good track record of my work in the cyber field.
